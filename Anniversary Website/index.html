      <p>First of all, thank you for all the patience you’ve shown, Love. I know our situation is difficult right now, but we can get through this—this is just a test for us.

I know you feel pressured and stressed, but I’m here for you, Love. Even though we argue sometimes, I still love you so much. Just hold on a little longer and wait for me, Love. Once I find a job and start earning my own money, I’ll come to you. Trust me—these two years we’ve spent in this relationship won’t go to waste.

I will stand by you. You’re the one I want to stand with at the altar, and you’re the one I want to be the mother of my children. So please, Love, just a little more patience. I love you! Happy anniversary, Love! Let’s make it up when we have money already, love. For now, let’s have a virtual celebration first, love. Soon, I’ll be with you to celebrate. Please wait for me, love, and always pray—because I always pray that I’ll be with you for the rest of my life.

Happy, happy 2nd anniversary, my love. I love you so much, my beautiful, feisty girlfriend—moody and all—I love you! ❤️</p>
